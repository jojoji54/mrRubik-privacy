# Privacy Policy – TypeClear

Effective date: [ADD DATE]

TypeClear is built to be privacy-first.

## 1. Data we collect
TypeClear does not require account creation and does not collect personal data for analytics or advertising.

## 2. Data stored on your device
TypeClear stores practice-related data locally on your device, such as:
- App settings (theme, accessibility, language, keyboard layout)
- Training progress and session history
- Diagnostic baseline and adaptive training state
- Pro unlock status

This data stays on your device unless you export it.

## 3. Exported files
If you use export features, CSV/JSON files are created on your device in locations you choose or your system default directory.

## 4. In-app purchases
Purchases are processed by Apple App Store / Google Play.
TypeClear does not receive your full payment details.
Store providers may process data under their own privacy policies.

## 5. Voice features
Text-to-speech behavior depends on the platform voice engine.
TypeClear sends text to the system TTS service to read lessons and accessibility prompts.

## 6. Data sharing
TypeClear does not sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing.

## 7. Children’s privacy
TypeClear can be used by children in learning contexts. No account is required and no direct personal data collection is intended.

## 8. Security
We use platform-standard local storage mechanisms. No method of storage is 100% secure, but we minimize data collection by design.

## 9. Your choices
You can:
- Reset or clear app data from your device settings
- Disable voice/accessibility features at any time
- Avoid exporting data if you prefer local-only usage

## 10. Changes to this policy
We may update this policy over time. Updates will be posted at this URL with a revised effective date.

Privacy Policy (Planazo)

Effective date: January 29, 2026
This Privacy Policy explains how Planazo (“the app”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the app.

1) Information we collect

A. Account information
When you sign in, we may collect:

A unique user identifier (UID)

Email address (if provided by your sign-in method)

Basic profile info (e.g., display name, photo) if available from your authentication provider

B. Content you create in the app
We collect and store the content you choose to create, such as:

Groups you join or create

Events and event details (title, date, location/city, budgets, notes, etc.)

Invitations you generate or accept

Any other information you voluntarily add within Planazo

C. Purchases and entitlements (if you buy Pro/Packs)
If you purchase subscriptions or in-app products, we may process:

Product identifiers (what you bought)

Purchase verification data/receipts needed to validate your purchase and unlock features
We do not collect your full payment card details. Payments are handled by Apple’s in-app purchase system.

D. Diagnostics (optional / depending on your setup)
We may collect limited diagnostic information to keep the app reliable, such as:

Crash reports and performance data

App version, device model, OS version
This data is used to troubleshoot issues and improve stability.

2) How we use your information

We use your information to:

Provide and operate the app (sign-in, groups, events, invites)

Sync your content across devices

Process and validate purchases (unlock features, restore purchases)

Provide customer support (replying to your emails and resolving issues)

Improve the app (bug fixing, performance and reliability)

3) Legal basis (where applicable)

Depending on your location, we process data under:

Performance of a contract (to provide the service you request)

Legitimate interests (security, fraud prevention, app improvement)

Consent (where you explicitly give it, if applicable)

4) Sharing of information

We do not sell your personal data.

We may share limited information only in these cases:

Service providers that help run the app (e.g., authentication, database hosting, purchase verification). They are allowed to process data only to provide services to us.

Legal obligations if required by law, court order, or to protect rights and safety.

Business changes (merger/acquisition) where data may be transferred as part of the transaction, subject to this policy.

5) Data storage and security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your data.
No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we aim to protect your information using industry-standard practices.

6) Data retention

We keep your data for as long as needed to:

Provide the app and its features

Comply with legal obligations

Resolve disputes and enforce agreements

You can request deletion of your account and associated data (see Section 8).

7) Children’s privacy

Planazo is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country).
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us information, contact us and we will delete it.

8) Your rights and choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

Access the data we hold about you

Correct inaccurate data

Request deletion of your account/data

Object to or restrict certain processing

Receive a copy of your data (data portability)

Account deletion request:

 with the subject “Planazo – Delete my account” and include the email used to sign in. We may ask for verification to prevent unauthorized deletion.

9) International transfers

Your data may be processed and stored in countries other than your own depending on where our providers operate. We take steps to protect your data in line with applicable law.

10) Third-party services and links

The app may rely on third-party services (e.g., authentication and in-app purchases). Their processing of your information is governed by their own privacy policies.

The app lets users play matches, store settings and scores on-device, and display ads.

## 3. Age and Acceptable Use
BombSort is intended for a general audience. If you are under legal age, use the app under parent/guardian supervision.  
Users agree to use the app lawfully and not to tamper with, decompile, or misuse it.

BombSort may offer a one-time in-app purchase to **remove ads** (currently planned at **EUR 1.99**, excluding taxes and potential store/country variations).  
Purchases, billing, renewals (if applicable), and refunds are handled exclusively by the platform store (Apple App Store / Google Play) under their own terms.

## 5. Advertising
The app uses Google AdMob ads (for example: banner, interstitial, rewarded, and app open ads, depending on availability).  
Ad personalization and related processing depend on user consent and applicable local regulations.

## 6. What Data We Process
### 6.1 Data handled by the app itself (on your device)
- Best score and local progress.
- Preferences (for example, music/sound settings, visual theme, and ad-removal purchase state).

This data is stored locally using on-device storage (SharedPreferences).

### 6.2 Data handled by integrated third parties
When using AdMob and app stores, third parties may process technical data, such as:
- Device or advertising identifiers.
- Approximate IP address and network/device information.
- Diagnostics and ad performance information.

BombSort does not require account creation and does not request name, national ID, postal address, or email to play.

## 7. Purposes and Legal Basis
We process data to:
- Provide gameplay and save local progress.
- Display and manage ads.
- Process ad-removal purchases and restorations.
- Comply with legal obligations and prevent fraud/abuse.

**Legal basis:** performance of the service, legal compliance, legitimate interest (security/fraud prevention), and consent where required (for example, ad privacy consent in certain regions).

## 8. Consent and Privacy Options
BombSort integrates Google's consent flow (UMP).  
Where applicable, users will see a privacy consent form and/or a **“Privacy Options”** entry point to review or change choices.

## 9. Data Retention
- Local data remains on the device until the user clears app data, uninstalls the app, or changes settings.
- Data processed by third parties (AdMob, App Store, Google Play) is retained under those providers' own policies.

## 10. Recipients and International Transfers
Data may be accessed by:
- Google (AdMob / Google Mobile Ads).
- Apple and Google as distribution and payment platforms.

These providers may operate outside the EEA. In such cases, they apply their own international transfer mechanisms and legal safeguards.

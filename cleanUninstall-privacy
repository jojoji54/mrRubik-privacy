# Privacy Policy for CleanUninstall

**Effective Date:** February 10, 2026

At CleanUninstall, your privacy is a priority. This Privacy Policy explains what information is processed when you use the app, how it is used, and how it is protected.

By using CleanUninstall, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

---

## Information We Process

CleanUninstall is designed to work locally on your Mac.

Depending on how you use the app, it may process:

- App and file/folder names and paths selected by you
- Related file paths found during cleanup scans
- File metadata needed for cleanup (for example, file size and type)
- Local app settings (for example, cleanup preferences)
- Local purchase state (Pro unlocked status)

CleanUninstall does **not** collect file contents for cloud processing and does **not** upload your scanned files to our servers.

---

## How We Use Information

Processed information is used only to provide app functionality, including:

- Scanning for related leftover files from apps you choose
- Displaying detected files so you can review them
- Moving selected files to Trash
- Managing Pro access and restore flow through Apple’s purchase system
- Showing in-app review prompts via Apple APIs

---

## Third-Party Services

CleanUninstall relies on Apple services for platform features:

- **App Store / StoreKit** (in-app purchases and restore)
- **Apple In-App Review API** (rating prompt)

These services are governed by Apple’s own privacy policies. CleanUninstall does not receive your full payment details.

---

## Full Disk Access Permission (macOS)

CleanUninstall may request **Full Disk Access** to detect more leftover files in protected locations.

- Granting this permission is optional.
- You can revoke it anytime in macOS Settings.
- Access is used only for local scan functionality on your device.

---

## Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data.  
We do not share scanned file data with advertisers or data brokers.

If you contact support, we may use the information you provide (such as your email and issue details) only to respond and provide assistance.

---

## Data Retention

Because CleanUninstall works locally, scanned data and settings remain on your device unless you delete the app or clear data manually.  
Purchase records are managed by Apple.

---

## Children’s Privacy

CleanUninstall is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be published with a revised Effective Date.

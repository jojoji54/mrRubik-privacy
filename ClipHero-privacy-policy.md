Privacy Policy for ClipHero

Effective Date: 29/12/2024

At ClipHero, your privacy is a top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you use our application. By using ClipHero, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

Information We Collect
ClipHero does not collect, store, or share your clipboard data or any other personal information. All processing occurs locally on your device to ensure your data remains private and secure.

How We Use Your Information
Since ClipHero operates entirely offline and processes data locally:

We do not transmit your clipboard contents to external servers.
No third parties have access to your clipboard data or app usage information.
Third-Party Services
ClipHero may integrate with third-party services (e.g., App Store for in-app purchases). These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. ClipHero itself does not collect or share any data with these services.

In-App Purchases
In-app purchases are processed securely through Apple’s App Store. ClipHero does not have access to your payment details or any sensitive transaction information.

Data Security
We take your data security seriously:

Clipboard history is stored only on your device and is not shared.
We use system-level sandboxing to protect your information and ensure the app operates within secure boundaries.
Children’s Privacy
ClipHero is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided personal data, we will delete it immediately.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or for legal and regulatory reasons. The updated policy will be posted in the app and on our website with the "Effective Date" updated accordingly.
